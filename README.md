Unit 18 Blockchain. Pychain.


- This project was run using streamlit.  The included photo shows the code running smoothly, over 5 different transactions.  Also, the code shows the resulting nonce using varying levels of difficulty. 
- The block inspector is a drop down menu option that allows the user to quickly analyze a particular transaction made on the blockchain network. 
- The Validation mechanism is also showing the proper result of true.  This means that the new block is hashing correctly using the previous blocks hash.
